867 different school districts and so that many documents.

Initially looking for the Annual outcomes.
These are in the tables with the row header Annual Outcomes.


It takes some time to convert a pdf document to XML, but only needs to be done once.
We can do these in parallel.
So on a machine with 8 cores, we might be able to do 

For pdf2txt, I did one 100 page document that was dense in text (a full text report, not a table)
in 1.5 minutes. So 108 of these would take almost 3 hours, but all 867 would take about the
same time in total when done in parallel. So probably no more than 4 hours.
If dones sequentially, 22 hours.

We also have to add on time to combine the individual symbols iinto sentences/phrases
and dos some of the computations to merge the contents.
For the 157 page Davis report, this took 11 seconds.
So all 867 would be about 3 hours.

Extracting the Annual Outcomes is essentially no time, i.e. .2 of a second for 157 pages.
